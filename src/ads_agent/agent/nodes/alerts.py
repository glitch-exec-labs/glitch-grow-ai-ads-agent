"""alerts: surface tracking + spend + bias-correction signals the user should act on.

Checks (per store):
  1. CPC drift vs family baseline ($3.50 for Urban-family)
  2. Spend up, revenue flat (last 7d vs prior 7d)
  3. Tracking gap (Meta purchases >> Shopify paid — dedup/CAPI issue)
  4. Premature-kill bias: ad sets paused in last 48h that were still inside
     the learning-phase window (<72h live + <$75 spent). This is the human-bias
     reminder ("you killed this too early, revive if you still believe").
  5. Underperformers that have burned budget with zero paid Shopify orders in 72h.

Returns a ranked list with each alert tagged by severity (🔴 act now / 🟡 watch / 🟢 info).
