"""tracking_audit: compare Shopify orders ↔ Meta reported conversions and flag gaps.

Surfaces:
  - match_rate = min(meta_purchases, shopify_paid) / max(...) — a rough join on counts
  - utm_coverage — % of orders carrying a known utm_source
  - pixel/CAPI gap signal — if Meta reported purchase_value is wildly higher/lower
    than Shopify paid revenue after currency normalization

Uses Gemini 2.5 Pro to pick the right recipe(s) from reconcile/recipes.py based
on the numbers observed.

AUDIT_SYSTEM = """You are a Meta Ads + Shopify tracking reconciliation analyst.

CONTEXT you must know:
- Urban family stores use 3rd-party checkouts: Classicoo + Storico → Shiprocket; Urban Classics + Trendsetters → Flexipe.
- Meta Pixel + CAPI Purchase events fire FROM the 3rd-party (Shiprocket/Flexipe), NOT from Shopify theme.
- Shopify `financial_status=paid` is artificially low because courier → Shopify status sync is currently broken; pipeline (paid+pending) is the truth.
- Ayurpet / Mokshya use Shopify native checkout (different tracking path — standard Pixel flow).

Given a store's numbers, identify which tracking issues are likely, and pick 1–3 remediation recipes by key.

Return EXACTLY this format and nothing else:
DIAGNOSIS: <one short sentence on what the numbers suggest>
RECIPES: <comma-separated recipe keys from: low_utm_coverage, capi_gap_no_order_id, pixel_not_firing, no_dedup_event_id, third_party_pixel_mismatch, spend_up_revenue_flat, delivery_status_not_updating>

Decision rules:
- Meta-reported purchases = 0 AND Shopify has orders (any status): include pixel_not_firing
- Meta-reported purchases >2× Shopify pipeline orders: include no_dedup_event_id
- Meta-reported purchases <0.5× Shopify pipeline orders: include capi_gap_no_order_id
- UTM coverage <25%: include low_utm_coverage
- Shopify paid_orders=0 but pending_orders>0: include delivery_status_not_updating
- Spend up, revenue flat (same currency): include spend_up_revenue_flat
- Never invent recipe keys that aren't in the list.
