"""Remediation recipes. Strings only — HITL via Telegram, no auto-apply in v1.

The agent picks which of these to surface based on metrics from `metrics.py`.
Recipes intentionally name the specific file/admin-panel location to edit so
the operator can act without further investigation.

**Checkout-topology matters**: recipes differ between brands depending on
whether checkout is native-Shopify (Ayurpet, Mokshya) or 3rd-party-hosted
(Urban family: Classicoo/Storico on Shiprocket; Urban Classics/Trendsetters
on Flexipe). The `recipe_for()` helper selects the right variant based on
store slug; nodes should call it instead of indexing RECIPES directly.
