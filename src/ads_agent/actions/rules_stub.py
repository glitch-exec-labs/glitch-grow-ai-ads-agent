"""Generic placeholder planner rules — deliberately NOT calibrated.

This module is the public-repo fallback when the private playbook package
`glitch_grow_ads_playbook` is not installed. A public clone of the engine
can run end-to-end with these stubs, but the thresholds are set far outside
the range of anything you'd want to trade on — propose-threshold of 3.0×
ROAS and scale-floor of 5.0× are deliberately loose so the engine proposes
rarely and only on obvious cases, without giving away the real calibration.

The tuned values live in the private package. See:
  https://github.com/glitch-exec-labs/glitch-grow-ads-agent-private

Contract (same as the private module):
  - RULES: tuple[Callable[[dict], ActionProposal | None], ...]
