"""Classify Meta-ad destination URLs.

Engine-level helper that's brand-neutral: every ad gets tagged
`amazon | shopify-ind | shopify-global | shopify-other | other`
plus an `ASIN` when the destination is an Amazon PDP. This lives in the
engine because the *data* is brand-agnostic; the *methodology* (whether
to use the halo number or pause on Meta-ROAS) lives per-brand in
`playbooks/<brand>.md` Section X.

Why we do this:
  - Meta has no visibility into Amazon orders, so any Amazon-destined ad
    structurally reads `omni_purchase = 0` in the Graph API insights —
    Meta-reported ROAS on those ads is a floor, not the truth.
  - A brand-tuned audit (e.g. Ayurpet's) needs to identify Amazon ads
    and use the cross-channel halo number from
    `ads_agent.amazon_attribution_daily_v` instead of Meta-ROAS, then
    propose `RECLAIM` rather than `PAUSE`.
  - Other brands without an `amazon` destination just see all ads tagged
    `shopify-*` and the existing methodology runs unchanged.

We do NOT follow `amzn.eu/d/<short>` redirects here — the resolver lives
inside `agent/analysis/meta_decomposer.py` so the network round-trip
stays in one place.
